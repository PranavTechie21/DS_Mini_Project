## 📈 Performance Characteristics

### Time Complexity
| Operation | Complexity | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Add Candidate | O(1) | Vector push_back |
| Find Candidate | O(n) | Linear search |
| Add Voter | O(1) | Vector push_back |
| Cast Vote | O(n) | Find voter + candidate |
| Display Results | O(n log n) | Sorting candidates |
| Analytics | O(n) to O(n²) | Depends on analysis type |
| File Save | O(n) | Iterate all records |
| File Load | O(n) | Read all records |

### Space Complexity
- **Candidates**: O(n) where n = number of candidates
- **Voters**: O(m) where m = number of voters
- **Regions**: O(r) where r = number of regions
- **Overall**: O(n + m + r)

### Scalability
- Suitable for elections with:
  - Up to 10,000 candidates
  - Up to 100,000 voters
